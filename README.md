[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/darmar9287/emles-distro.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/darmar9287/emles-distro)
===========================
This project has been made to make distribution of emles sauces easier.
===========================
### Running the app locally
===========================
You need to have docker and docker-compose installed on your machine.
To run all containers enter in your terminal:
    `docker-compose up`
After a while all containers should be up.
Authorization server runs on [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
Resource server runs on [localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001) - see `docker-compose.yml`.
### Running the tests
===========================
First, check id of container on which works Authorization server or Resource server:
`docker ps`. Then, enter in terminal:
`docker exec -it <container_id> mvn clean verify`
this command will run all tests with coverage check and static code analysis. All sources generated by jacoco and codestyle should be available under `target` directory of chosen Spring Boot application.
### For contributors
===========================
Never push new changes to the master branch directly. First, push your changes into feature branch:
`git push -u origin feature` and create pull-request.
